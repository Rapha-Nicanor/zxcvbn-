            <br>
            <h1>EARYLY CHILDHOOD</h1>
            <p><b>1861</b><br> José Rizal was born on June 19, 1861, in Calamba, Laguna province, to Francisco Rizal Mercado y Alejandro and Teodora Alonso Realonda y Quintos.</p>
            <p><b>Patrilineal Lineage</b><br> Rizal's patrilineal lineage traced back to Fujian, China, through his father's ancestor Lam-co, who migrated to the Philippines in the late 17th century. Lam-co later converted to Catholicism and changed his name to Domingo Mercado.</p>
            <p><b>Maternal Ancestry</b><br> Rizal's maternal ancestry included Chinese, Tagalog, and Spanish roots. His mother, Teodora Alonso Realonda, descended from the affluent Florentina family of Chinese mestizos from Baliuag, Bulacan. He also had Spanish ancestry through his maternal grandmother, Regina Ochoa, and Japanese ancestry through his maternal great-great-grandfather, Eugenio Ursua.</p>
            <p><b>Early Education and Name Change</b><br> José Rizal exhibited a precocious intellect from an early age, learning the alphabet at 3 and reading and writing by age 5. He enrolled at the Ateneo Municipal de Manila, where he dropped the last three names of his full name on the advice of his brother, Paciano, and the Mercado family. This rendered his name as "José Protasio Rizal" to enable him to travel freely and disassociate him from his brother's notoriety.</p>
            <p><b>1891</b><br> By 1891, Rizal had gained fame as a poet, essayist, and novelist, earning recognition for his facility with Castilian and other foreign languages. His second surname, Rizal, became well-known, symbolizing persecution. Rizal embraced the name, stating his desire to be worthy of the family name.</p>
                <p><b>22 June 1861</b><br>He was baptized JOSE RIZAL MERCADO at the Catholic of Calamba by the parish priest Rev. Rufino Collantes with Rev. Pedro Casañas as the sponsor.<br>
                <br>
                <b>28 September 1862</b><br>The parochial church of Calamba and the canonical books, including the book in which Rizal’s baptismal records were entered, were burned.<br>
                <br>
                <b>1864</b><br>Barely three years old, Rizal learned the alphabet from his mother.<br>
                <br>
                <b>1865</b><br>When he was four years old, his sister Conception, the eight child in the Rizal family, died at the age of three. It was on this occasion that Rizal remembered having shed real tears for the first time.<br>
                <br>
                <b>1865 – 1867</b><br>During this time his mother taught him how to read and write. His father hired a classmate by the name of Leon Monroy who, for five months until his (Monroy) death, taught Rizal the rudiments of Latin.<br>
                At about this time two of his mother’s cousin frequented Calamba. Uncle Manuel Alberto, seeing Rizal frail in body, concerned himself with the physical development of his young nephew and taught the latter 
                love for the open air and developed in him a great admiration for the beauty of nature, while Uncle Gregorio, a scholar, instilled into the mind of the boy love for education. He advised Rizal: "Work hard 
                and perform every task very carefully; learn to be swift as well as thorough; be independent in thinking and make visual pictures of everything."<br>
                <br>
                <b> 6 June 1868</b><br>With his father, Rizal made a pilgrimage to Antipolo to fulfill the vow made by his mother to take the child to the Shrine of the Virgin of Antipolo should she and her child survive the ordeal of delivery which nearly caused his mother’s life.<br>
                From there they proceeded to Manila and visited his sister Saturnina who was at the time studying in the La Concordia College in Sta. Ana.<br>
                <br>
                <b>1869</b><br>At the age of eight, Rizal wrote his first poem entitled "Sa Aking Mga Kabata." The poem was written in tagalog and had for its theme "Love of One’s Language."</p>

            <p><b>May 3, 1882</b><br>Rizal left Philippines to complete his studies in Spain. He boarded the Salvadora using a passport of the name Jose Mercado.</p>
            <p><b>Secret Mission</b><br>Observe the life and culture, customs, governments and laws of European nations in order to prepare himself in the task of liberating the Filipino people from Spanish tyranny. Rizal’s departure was kept secret to avoid detection from Spanish authorities and the friars.</p>
            <p><b>Spain (1882-1885)</b><br>José Rizal embarked on his journey to Spain in 1882 to pursue higher education at the Universidad Central de Madrid. Over the span of three years, he immersed himself in rigorous academic training, studying Medicine and the Humanities. Rizal actively engaged with the Filipino community in Madrid, participating in discussions about the Philippines' colonial situation. These experiences laid the groundwork for his later advocacy for Filipino nationalism and social reform.</p>
            <p><b>Europe (1886-1887)</b><br>In 1886, Rizal embarked on a tour of Europe, visiting France, Germany, Belgium, Austria-Hungary, and Italy. Seeking to broaden his intellectual horizons, he studied at the University of Heidelberg in Germany and explored the cultural heritage of various European nations. Rizal's time in Europe profoundly influenced his views on colonialism, nationalism, and societal reform, shaping his identity as a nationalist and intellectual leader.</p>
            <p><b>Return to the Philippines (1887)</b><br>Rizal returned to the Philippines in 1887, bringing with him a wealth of experiences and knowledge acquired during his years abroad.

            <p><b>Europe and Dapitan (1892-1896)</b><br>Returning to Europe in 1892, Rizal continued his efforts to raise awareness about the plight of the Filipino people and rally support for social reform. Despite facing increasing pressure from Spanish authorities, he remained committed to his cause. However, his exile to Dapitan in 1896, following allegations of involvement in the Katipunan, forced him to continue his advocacy efforts from afar. Despite the challenges of exile, Rizal remained dedicated to his cause, establishing a school, conducting scientific research, and providing medical assistance to the local community.</p>

                <p><b>El Filibusterismo (The Reign of Greed)</b><br>Rizal's sequel to "Noli Me Tangere," titled "El Filibusterismo," delves even deeper into the themes of social inequality and political corruption under Spanish colonial rule. Published in 1891, this novel presents a darker and more cynical portrayal of Philippine society, exploring the consequences of oppression and exploitation. Through the enigmatic character of Simoun, Rizal depicts the moral complexities of revolution and the ethical dilemmas faced by those seeking change through violent means. "El Filibusterismo" serves as a cautionary tale about the dangers of unchecked power and the urgent need for social reform to address the root causes of discontent and unrest.</p>

    <!--JOSE RIZAL"S DEATH-->
    <section id="lasthour">
    <div class="last">
        <br>
    <h1>RIZAL’S LAST HOURS</h1>
    <p>On December 26, 1896, the military court tried Jose Rizal and later found him guilty of rebellion, sedition, and conspiracy. The Spanish authorities believed that Rizal’s writings “fatally and necessarily” incited the rebellion which, by 1896, had already become a revolution. On December 29 at 6 a.m., Capt. Rafael Dominguez read before Rizal his death sentence. His execution was scheduled the following day.<br>
        <br>
        At around 7 a.m. of December 29, Rizal was transferred to his death cell in Fort Santiago. There he received numerous visitors, including his counsel; some Spanish officials; and several priests, his former professors, with whom he supposedly discussed reason and religion. The Archbishop of Manila, Rev. Bernardino Nozaleda, recalled: “During that day, although Rizal did not reject [the Jesuits], he persisted in his errors contrary to the Catholic faith.… However, at the last hour, Rizal abjured, in writing, his religious errors.” In other words, Rizal, a Mason, was said to have recanted his statements against the Church and to have returned to the Catholic faith.<br>
        <br>
        The controversy over Rizal’s retraction has not been settled. The “original” document of Rizal’s “retraction” was found in the archdiocesan archives in 1935, 39 years after having disappeared the day Rizal was shot. There was no record of anybody seeing this “original” document in 1896, except the publishers of La Voz Española, which published its contents on the day of Rizal’s execution: “We have seen and read his (Rizal’s) own handwritten retraction which he sent to our dear and venerable Archbishop….” Most experts think that the handwriting on the document is authentic. However, scholars are baffled as to why Rizal, who courageously faced persecution for most of his life, and who was finally sentenced to death for his beliefs, would suddenly balk at the last, futile moment. (For more discussion on Rizal’s retraction, see Garcia, 1964; Guerrero, 1998; and Vaño, 1985).<br>
        <br>
        In his last hours Rizal read the Bible and Thomas à Kempis’s Imitation of Christ, which he later dedicated to Josephine Bracken. He also wrote the poem “Mi Ultimo Adiós,” which he concealed in an alcohol burner. When his family came to see him, he asked pardon from his mother and talked to his sisters as they entered his cell one by one. He also wrote letters. In his last letter, addressed to Paciano Rizal, he asked his brother to ask their father for forgiveness for all the pain he had caused him. To his friend Ferdinand Blumentritt, he wrote: “When you receive this letter, I shall be dead by then…. Tomorrow at seven, I shall be shot; but I am innocent of the crime of rebellion…. I am going to die with a tranquil conscience.”<br>
        <br>
        At 7 a.m. on December 30, 1896 at Luneta, Manila, the 35-year-old patriot was shot in the back by a firing squad. He hesitated, turned halfway around to face his executioners, and fell on his back to face the Philippine sun</p>
